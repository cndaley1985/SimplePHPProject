SimplePHPProject
================

To provide a web portal/content aggregation site that will display a number of RSS Feeds related to iPhone Applications and Development.

The design document has information pertaining to the DB schema that should be created to support this application. 

The DB connection information is hard coded in authenticat.php, therefore, the created database should have these values inserted, or feel free to change the user credentials in your local working copy of SimplePHPProject. 

Note: I will later update this repository with a more detailed step by step instruction on how to deploy the application with the require DDL and DML statements.
